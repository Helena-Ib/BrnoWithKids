      Travelling with kids
    </h2>
<p>
  Having kids forces us to make changes to our tried and tested routines. And travelling with children is no different. And, like most things child-related, you’ll struggle to remember what travelling was like before they came along.
</p>
<h3>
  What to pack on a family day out
</h3>
<p>
  Most of us take far too much stuff just leaving the house for a few hours with our kids, let alone for a whole holiday. But, though an entire industry may want us to think differently, (whisper it) kids really don’t need that much stuff. Here are the things we reckon are worth making space for.
</p>
<h4>Pram</h4>
<p>
  Even if you’ve got a preschooler who loves to walk, days out can be tiring for little ones. Taking a pram will save their legs and give them a place to nap without the need to head back to your home. 
</p>
<h4>
  Baby carrier
</h4>
<p>
It could be a long walk from the start of your walk to the final destination, so a baby carrier or sling is a must-have until you’re reunited with your buggy. 
</p>
  
<h4>
  First Aid Kit
</h4>
<p>
  Children are germ magnets at the best of times, so the chances they’ll get sick or injured on a walk aren’t exactly low. A well-stocked family first aid kit is a must for your suitcase.
</p>
<p>
  What to include in a first aid kit?
</p>
<p>
  Paralen and Nurofen come in sachets which are handy for taking out and about, while plasters,desinfection (Jodisol), scisors, a thermometer, saline nasal drops, and Sudokrem should get you through minor health mishaps.
