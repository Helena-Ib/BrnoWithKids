<h3>
  Preventing tick bites
</h3>
<p>
  Tick exposure can occur year-round, but ticks are most active during warmer months (April-September). 
</p>

<p>
  Before You Go Outdoors:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  •	Know where to expect ticks. Ticks live in grassy, brushy, or wooded areas, or even on animals. Spending time outside walking your dog, camping, gardening, or hunting could bring you in close contact with ticks. Many people get ticks in their own yard or neighborhood.
</li>

<li>
  •	Treat clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin. Permethrin can be used to treat boots, clothing and camping gear and remain protective through several washings. Alternatively, you can buy permethrin-treated clothing and gear.
</li>

<li>
  •	Use Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE)
</li>

<li>
  •	Avoid Contact with Ticks - wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  After You Come Indoors
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Check your clothing for ticks. Ticks may be carried into the house on clothing. Any ticks that are found should be removed. Tumble dry clothes in a dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill ticks on dry clothing after you come indoors. If the clothes are damp, additional time may be needed. If the clothes require washing first, hot water is recommended. Cold and medium temperature water will not kill ticks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Examine gear and pets. Ticks can ride into the home on clothing and pets, then attach to a person later, so carefully examine pets, coats, and daypacks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shower soon after being outdoors. Showering within two hours of coming indoors has been shown to reduce your risk of getting Lyme disease and may be effective in reducing the risk of other tickborne diseases. Showering may help wash off unattached ticks and it is a good opportunity to do a tick check.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check your body for ticks after being outdoors. Conduct a full body check upon return from potentially tick-infested areas, including your own backyard. Use a hand-held or full-length mirror to view all parts of your body. Check these parts of your body and your child’s body for ticks:
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you find a tick attached to your skin, there’s no need to panic—the key is to remove the tick as soon as possible. There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of fine-tipped tweezers work very well.
</p>

<h3>
  How to remove a tick
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin’s surface as possible
  </li>
  <li>
    Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don’t twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.
  </li>
  <li>
    After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never crush a tick with your fingers. Dispose of a live tick by putting it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed bag/container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it down the toilet.
  </li>
</ul>
