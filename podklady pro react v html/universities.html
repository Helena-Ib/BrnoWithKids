          <h2>At the University</h2>
          <p>
            Universities and colleges provide tertiary education which lasts from 4 to 6 years. Each secondary school graduate can apply for as many universities and colleges as he/she likes but before he/she is accepted they have to pass an entrance examination in the subjects in which the university specialises. The examination consists of a written test and an interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            Undergraduates can study a variety of subjects such as economics, foreign trade, architecture, law, journalism, the humanities, foreign languages, medicine, science, music, art, drama, engineering or computer science at various schools e.g. School of Economics or Architecture, Law, Medical or Science Faculty, Faculty of Journalism, Teachers' Training College, Art School, College of Agriculture, technical universities or polytechnics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The university or college students can enrol at three-year courses for a Bachelor’s Degree or four and five-year courses for a Master’s Degree. Medicine usually takes 6 years. The university or college study is finished with a state examination and every undergraduate also has to write a thesis in order to receive a diploma in a certain field of study. The diploma is handed over at a graduation ceremony. Doctoral Degrees are awarded after other few years of study, which may be also individual, and completion of another thesis.

            Full-time university students are expected to bear the expense of their tuition and they also have to pay for their accommodation and board. The students from distant places usually lodge at a hall of residence (dorm). Only a limited number of students get a grant or a scholarship.
            For those who do not want to enter the university there are various types of two-year training courses such as for managers, businessmen, social workers, specialised nurses or language experts.
