          <h2>Travelling with a stroller</h2>
          <p>
            Until all physical barriers to the movement of strollers on our transport lines can be removed, we hope that passengers needing assistance will be able to get any help needed from fellow passengers and transport staff (recognizing that such help is optional and not an obligation). For public transportation to be successful as a service to all, those needing special assistance will unfortunately need to rely on a nearby fellow passenger or member of the transit staff to help. Such consideration is particularly important when there are crowded conditions; and, whenever necessary, we ask all of our passengers to give priority to wheelchair users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bus drivers usually try to make it easier for passengers who are traveling with strollers to exit by opening the central door for them.
          </p>

          <h2>Before Boarding</h2>
          <p>
            At the stop, it is recommended that passengers wait for the arrival of the transport vehicle at that part of the stop where they expect the entry door to be located when the vehicle arrives. To signal drivers that you want to board, raise your arm.
          </p>
          <h2>Placement of the Stroller in the Transport Vehicle</h2>
          
          <p>In terms of location on vehicle platforms, strollers have priority. Depending on the occupancy of the transport vehicle and the number of strollers (and wheelchairs) in the vehicle, it is possible to use the space set aside for strollers in various ways (in other words, if there are fewer strollers, a passenger can use the fold-down seat located in the stroller storage area; otherwise strollers always have priority for this area). We ask that passengers traveling with strollers (and wheelchair passengers) always try to find out about the upcoming stops of fellow passengers and pre-position themselves, as best they can, for their own stop. This will help avoid departure and boarding delays, which can impact transit line schedules.</p>
          <p>We recommend that upon boarding and when getting ready to de-board, that you place the stroller in such a way as to minimize any unnecessary maneuvering of it (unless this would otherwise disrupt the movement of other passengers). Brake the stroller and, if possible, secure it against any sudden shifting (making use of the design of the stroller or hold it properly). If possible, lower the handle of the stroller so that it protrudes as little as possible into the space.</p>
          <p>It can be difficult to control the direction of forward motion of strollers with rotating front wheels and this can be a particular problem if the recommended boarding procedures are not followed when boarding such strollers onto low-floor vehicles. Additional attention must also be paid when traveling with strollers for two children (next to each other / behind each other / above each other) and with some sportier versions of strollers.</p>
        
        <h2>Before Exiting the Transport Vehicle</h2>
        <p>
          The “Stroller” Button – Before arriving at their intended stop, it is necessary for passengers traveling with a stroller to signal the tram or bus driver of their intention to exit the vehicle  using the related “exit” button (on some vehicles this is done by “double” pressing the button to signal the driver). For those vehicles with demand door control, it is necessary to press the appropriate button (on some types of buses, the door closest to the pressed stroller exit button is automatically activated). Then all that remains is to prepare to exit the vehicle (ask to clear the way, unbrake the stroller and possibly direct it to the door).

        </p>
        <h2>Getting on</h2>
        <p>
          Low-floor vehicles - enter with the front of the stroller going first and push from behind.        

        </p>
        <p>
          Vehicles with stairs – lift the stroller onto the vehicle using the front handle and pull the stroller up (hopefully with assistance to push the bottom part of the stroller up from behind) to enter the vehicle.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is strongly recommended not to try and push the stroller up the stairs from the bottom (lower part) of the stroller – instead, always pull the stroller up the stairs from the front handle!
        </p>

        <h2>Getting off</h2>
        <p>Low-floor vehicles - always back the stroller out of the vehicle by pulling it from behind you. You exit first!

        </p>

        <p>
          It is strongly recommended not to try and exit the vehicle by pushing the stroller out first. Always exit the vehicle before the stroller!
