                      Transport of a bicycle in the means of the Brno Public Transport is not complicated at all. Quite the contrary – the possibilities of travelling with a bicycle have significantly expanded in recent years and you can take a bicycle with yourself to all kinds of public transport, except for buses. By enabling the transport of bicycles, the public transport helps overcome less safe sections in busy city streets, or elevation, or makes healthy cycling easier even for less proficient cyclists
