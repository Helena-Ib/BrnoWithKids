          <h2>Vaccination in the Czech Republic</h2>
          <p>Regular, special and emergency vaccinations against infectious diseases are provided to insured persons under the obligation of such persons to accept needed care. Vaccinations are provided free-of-charge.</p>
          <p>The obligation to allow oneself to be vaccinated applies to the following persons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><img class="sipka" src="icons/sipkafinal.jpg" alt="šipka" /><span class="activities">A natural person who is a permanent resident in the Czech Republic</span></li>
            <li><img class="sipka" src="icons/sipkafinal.jpg" alt="šipka" /><span class="activities"></span>A foreign national who has been granted permanent residency status in the Czech Republic</span></li>
            <li><img class="sipka" src="icons/sipkafinal.jpg" alt="šipka" /><span class="activities"></span>A foreign national who is entitled to permanent residence in the Czech Republic</span></li>
            <li><img class="sipka" src="icons/sipkafinal.jpg" alt="šipka" /><span class="activities"></span>A foreign national who has been granted temporary residence in the Czech Republic for a period longer than 90 days or who is entitled to reside in the Czech Republic for a period longer than 90 days.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Mandatory for attending a nursery</h2>
          <p>Children can only attend a nursery or preschool if they have received the required regular vaccinations, have evidence of immunity against a particular disease or evidence that they cannot be vaccinated due to a permanent contraindication (a prohibition against vaccination for health reasons).</p>
          <p>Legitimate vaccination is fully covered by the state. In the context of compulsory vaccination, you can use a different vaccine endorsed by the Ministry of Health (in accordance with section 47 of Act No. 258/2000 concerning the protection of public health). This vaccine must be registered in the Czech Republic and then paid for by a parent.</p>
          <p>In case of premature babies, primary vaccination by hexavalent vaccine is done by Infanrix hexa at 3+1 scheme</p>
